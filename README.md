This is an Android app that receives a melody through a virtual keyboard, displays it on a stave, and calculates appropriate backing chords.
It then lets the user preview the melody and edit it if required.

It's a final year group project, created by Volodymyr Sereda, Niamh O'Reilly, and Méabh Ní Ghruagáin ^_^
